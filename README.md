# Scripts
Actually Useful Python Scripts
 PDFCombiner.py - It accepts multiple location paths in the terminal and conbines them into a "super.pdf" if you want another name just edit the .py file and change where it says super to whatever name you want
 PDFMerger.py - Same as the PDFCombiner but adds the pdfs on top of each other, useful for watermarks
